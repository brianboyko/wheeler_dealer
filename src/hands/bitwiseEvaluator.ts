 * Okay - this is where JS gets freaky. Javascript uses only 32 bit integers,

 * exactly 52 bits left...

 * Now, the problem is that you can't use bitwise operators on floats in JS.
 * Doing so would immediately convert it to an integer.
 * You CAN however, use normal math including modulo and Math.pow()
 *
 * So it's possible to set a nibble for each of the 13 ranks...
 * and assign a bit for each time one occurs.  Kings full of jacks, for example,
 * can be represented as the number 123351460741120, or
 * 0000 0111 0000 0011 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
